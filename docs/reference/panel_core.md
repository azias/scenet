# Panel Core

The resolved intermediate format, between the authored source and emitted SVG.

```
*.panel.yaml   →   IR   →   *.core.json   →   *.svg
authored           validated   resolved         rendered
```

## Why this tier exists

Vega-Lite compiles a high-level grammar into a lower-level one before emitting SVG, rather than
going straight to pixels. The same split pays for itself here, in four ways:

1. **Tests target stable numbers, not markup.** Golden-file tests compare Panel Core JSON, which
   changes only when layout genuinely changes. Diffing SVG text is brittle: reordered attributes or
   a changed path-rounding convention produce enormous diffs that mean nothing.
2. **Layouts can be adjusted by hand.** An artist who wants one balloon two millimetres left can
   edit the Core file, without touching the source or re-running the solver.
3. **One input, several emitters.** SVG, the debug overlay, and later formats all consume the same
   resolved tier.
4. **The high-level grammar stays a strict subset of the low-level one**, so nothing expressible in
   the source is inexpressible after resolution.

## Properties

- **Fully numeric.** Every position, size and scale is an absolute number in panel units. No
  `left_third`, no `medium_shot` — those are resolved away.
- **Still named.** Actors, balloons and anchors keep their source identifiers, so a Core file is
  readable and diffable. This is what separates it from SVG.
- **Deterministic.** Floats are rounded to a fixed precision on emission, so identical input yields
  byte-identical Core output on any platform.

## Shape

```json
{
  "panel": { "width": 1000, "height": 1000 },
  "actors": [
    {
      "id": "alice",
      "reference": "alice",
      "pose": "pointing",
      "transform": { "x": 208.33, "y": 140.0, "scale": 0.72, "mirrored": false },
      "anchors": { "mouth": [263.1, 268.4], "eyes": [259.0, 251.2], "feet": [270.0, 680.0] },
      "face_exclusion": { "cx": 259.0, "cy": 255.0, "r": 46.8 },
      "gaze": [1.0, 0.0],
      "hull": [[180.2, 140.0], [340.5, 140.0], "..."]
    }
  ],
  "balloons": [
    {
      "id": "b0",
      "speaker": "alice",
      "order": 0,
      "box": { "x": 60.0, "y": 55.0, "width": 330.0, "height": 118.0 },
      "lines": ["You forgot your", "umbrella!"],
      "tail": { "kind": "straight", "from": [225.0, 173.0], "to": [263.1, 268.4] }
    }
  ]
}
```

`lines` is the *resolved* line breaking, not the source string. Wrapping is decided during
compilation using real font metrics, so the emitter never re-measures and never disagrees with the
solver about how wide a balloon needs to be.
